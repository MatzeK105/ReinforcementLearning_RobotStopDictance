# ReinforcementLearning_RobotStopDictance

As a students project we need to implement Reinforcement Learning on our robot. One idea is that the robot learns to stop in time when an obstacle occurs. To get started, the robot will have static velocity and decceleration, therefore this variables could be ignored in the algorithm. But later they should be considered because they are mutable.

This idea will be __simulated__ in this repository.
