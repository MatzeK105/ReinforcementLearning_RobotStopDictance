# ReinforcementLearning_RobotStopDictance

## Idea
As a students project we need to implement Reinforcement Learning on our robot. One idea is that the robot learns to stop in time when an obstacle occurs. To get started, the robot will have static velocity and deceleration, therefore this variables could be ignored in the algorithm. But later they should be considered because they are mutable.

This idea will be __simulated__ in this repository. The Reinfocment Learning technique will be Sarsa.

## Run program
Just type `python run.py` in your terminal to start the program.

Note: You have to use Python 3.x

## Links
The code is based on MorvanZhou's tutorial projects to Reinforcment Learning. He has very good tutorials on Reinforcement Learning.
